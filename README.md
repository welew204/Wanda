# HeartBeat

This is a crime-statistic viewing app, built with Django and pulling in data from the [City of Oakland 90-Day CrimeWatch data](https://data.oaklandca.gov/Public-Safety/CrimeWatch-Maps-Past-90-Days/ym6k-rx7a/data). 

It features user auth, graphical representation of the data with pygal, [interactive webmaps built with MapboxGLJS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs), and CRUD functionality to allow the user to note visual evidence of crimes based. 

For this portfolio project I was interested in creating a simple dashboard for Oakland neighbors to get up-to-date information about crime around them.
